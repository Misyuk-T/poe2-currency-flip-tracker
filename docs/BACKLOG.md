Ideas parked for later. Not committed work — candidates to pull into a phase.
Newest first.

## Inventory valuation ("оцінка всього інвентарю")
Value a player's entire inventory/stash against current CX market data: paste or
import a set of items → total worth in exalted/divine, per-item breakdown,
liquidity/volume flags, and "what's actually sellable vs dead weight". Natural
extension once the identity/mapping layer (Metadata → name/icon/price) exists,
since valuation needs exactly that map plus current ratios. Open questions:
- Input source: manual entry, stash-tab import (needs OAuth/account scope — the
  CX CDN is account-agnostic), or a poe2scout-style paste?
- Anchor: value in exalted + divine; show gold-cost-to-liquidate (ties into the
  existing gold wedge).

## API opportunities to explore
The public CDN gives more than hourly ratios — worth a dedicated exploration
session to find features the giants don't ship:
- **volume_traded / lowest_stock / highest_stock** per pair per hour — depth,
  liquidity, and "is this flip actually fillable" signals (we store these already
  but barely surface them).
- **All leagues in one stream** — cross-league arbitrage / league-launch economy
  comparisons, HC vs SC premiums.
- **PoE1 + PoE2** from one client — cross-game currency-economy views.
- Long history back to Dec 2024 — seasonal/league-cycle trend analysis, "how this
  league's economy compares to prior leagues at the same day-N".
- Derived metrics: realized spread, volume-weighted price, stock-turnover, and
  detecting manipulation/thin markets.

TODO: schedule an exploration session to prototype 1-2 of these against real data.
